# Swift Programming Language

**Welcome to the Swift Debugger and REPL!**

Swift is a new, high performance systems programming language.  It has a clean
and modern syntax, and offers seamless access to existing C and Objective-C code
and frameworks, and is memory safe (by default).

This repository covers the Swift Debugger and REPL support, built on
top of the LLDB Debugger.

Stay tuned for more to come!
